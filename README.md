# CF-Instacart
For the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program project, I tackled business problems for Instacart using Jupyter notebooks and Python libraries. The final report details the analysis methodology, answers key questions, and provides recommendations for stakeholders.

## Objective
In my study project I am supposed to be an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions
•	What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?

•	What times of the day show higher spending patterns?

•	How can product pricing be simplified?

•	What are the most popular product departments based on order frequency?

•	What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?

•	What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?

•	What differences are there in the ordering habits of different customer profiles?

•	What is the ordering behaviour of customers by customer region?

## Data and Tools
Data sources included [The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017), and the customer data and price column, both of which were created for the purpose of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course.

Using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda library manager, I conducted the analysis using Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn. 

## Project Deliverables
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/MarynaBotas/CF-Instacart/tree/main/Scripts) documenting the analysis process and code implementation using Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn).

[Data visualizations](https://github.com/MarynaBotas/CF-Instacart/tree/main/Visualizations) generated to illustrate key findings.
